## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack locked: Vite + React + Tailwind + TanStack Query, Vercel deploy
- MAAS2/Curiosity REMS chosen over Perseverance MEDA for v1 (PDS too complex)
- Lunar surface temp is a phase-based model (clearly labeled estimate), not LRO Diviner live data
- Client-side API calls only — no backend proxy unless `DEMO_KEY` rate limits hit
- Moon tab's three sub-sections (Lunar / SWPC / DONKI) ship as parallelizable plans inside one phase
