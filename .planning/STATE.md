# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-14)

**Core value:** A single cinematic dashboard showing current Mars and Moon conditions from real NASA/NOAA APIs, presented so non-experts find it compelling and accessible.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Scaffold & Shell

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Scaffold & Shell) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack locked: Vite + React + Tailwind + TanStack Query, Vercel deploy
- MAAS2/Curiosity REMS chosen over Perseverance MEDA for v1 (PDS too complex)
- Lunar surface temp is a phase-based model (clearly labeled estimate), not LRO Diviner live data
- Client-side API calls only — no backend proxy unless `DEMO_KEY` rate limits hit
- Moon tab's three sub-sections (Lunar / SWPC / DONKI) ship as parallelizable plans inside one phase
- Phase 1 Plan 1: Wrote Vite scaffold files directly (no npm create vite) — non-empty working dir would hang the interactive prompt under autonomous execution
- Phase 1 Plan 1: Pinned tailwindcss to ^3.4.0 (not v4) for ecosystem stability
- Phase 1 Plan 1: Omitted /vite.svg favicon link to keep console clean and avoid demo-asset 404
